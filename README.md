# Manual Coverage Badge ‚úÖ
A composite action to manually create a coverage badge for a repository, using [`pytest-cov`](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) with the [shields.io](https://shields.io/) service.

It will also upload the full html coverage report as an artifact which can be easily deployed to your Github pages.

## Setup
The action has three strict setup requirements:

#### 1. Generate coverage reports using `pytest-cov`
You must have installed [`pytest-cov`](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) and in your testing step, run the test with the `--cov` and `--cov-report` flags to generate a coverage report.

For example:
```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=<package_name> --cov-report html --cov-report json:<package_name>_coverage.json
```
> **üìù Note:** It's a good idea to specify a unique name per package for the json report (as in the above example), because this filename will be used for the Github gist, and the result might be overwritten if they share the same Github user and filename.

#### 2. Create a Github gist
This action stores the result online as a JSON file in Github gist. Therefore, you must create a Github gist and add the gist id as a secret to your repository.

Go to [https://gist.github.com/](https://gist.github.com/) and create a secret gist. The filename should be the same as the JSON report generated by `pytest-cov` (see above).

Copy the gist id from the url, it should look something like this: `https://gist.github.com/<username>/<gist_id>`.

In your repository on Github, go to `Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`, create a new repository secret called `GIST_ID` and paste in the gist id.

#### 3. Create a Github personal access token
Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a personal access token with the `gist` scope. 

Copy the token and save it as another repository secret called `GIST_TOKEN`.

## Usage
See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action's inputs and outputs.

### Generate a simple badge
When the setup is complete, here is how you would use the action to generate a custom coverage badge:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    # ...
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Run tests
        run: poetry run pytest --cov=<package_name> --cov-report html --cov-report json:<package_name>_coverage.json

      - name: Create coverage badge
        uses: simula-consulting/manual-coverage-badge@v1
        with:
          coverage-json: <package_name>_coverage.json
          coverage-gist-token: ${{ secrets.GIST_TOKEN }}
          coverage-gist-id: ${{ secrets.GIST_ID }}
```

The badge will be created and can be found at:
```
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<gist-id>/raw/<your_package>_coverage.json
```

### Deploy the full coverage report to Github pages
This action will automatically store an `html` artifact with the full coverage report. You can deploy this to Github pages easily with the [`actions/deploy-pages`](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) workflow.

Here is an example workflow:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    # ...
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Run tests
        run: poetry run pytest --cov=<package_name> --cov-report html --cov-report json:<package_name>_coverage.json

      - name: Create coverage badge
        uses: simula-consulting/manual-coverage-badge@v1
        with:
          coverage-json: <package_name>_coverage.json
          coverage-gist-token: ${{ secrets.GIST_TOKEN }}
          coverage-gist-id: ${{ secrets.GIST_ID }}
  
  deploy:
    needs: test

    permissions:
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** Version `v4` or higher of deploy-pages is required.
